        "description": "Add a server-side cache that stores resolved airport metadata for 30 days to eliminate redundant external API calls.",
        "details": "1. Cache Choice & Setup\n   • Use Redis (preferred for TTL support and speed). `docker run -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine`\n   • Add `ioredis` ^5.x to the backend: `npm i ioredis`.\n   • Expose host/port/credentials via environment variables (`REDIS_URL`).\n\n2. Data Model\n   • Key pattern: `airport:<iata|icao>` (e.g. `airport:LHR`).\n   • Value: JSON-stringified object returned by the airport-lookup service plus metadata `{ data: {...}, source:\"external\", fetchedAt: 1680705582 }`.\n   • TTL: 2 592 000 s (30 days). Make TTL configurable via `AIRPORT_CACHE_TTL`.\n\n3. Caching Layer\n   • Create `services/airportCache.ts` exporting:\n     ```ts\n     export async function getAirport(code:string){ ... }\n     export async function setAirport(code:string, data:Airport, ttl:number){ ... }\n     ```\n   • Wrap existing airport-lookup logic:\n     ```ts\n     export async function resolveAirport(code:string){\n         const cached = await getAirport(code);\n         if(cached) return {...cached, source:\"cache\"};\n\n         const fresh = await externalApiResolve(code);\n         await setAirport(code, fresh, TTL);\n         return {...fresh, source:\"api\"};\n     }\n     ```\n   • Ensure concurrent requests for the same miss don’t trigger multiple API calls; use Redis `SETNX` or a mutex library (e.g. `redlock`).\n\n4. Purging Strategy\n   • Rely on Redis key expiration for automatic eviction.\n   • Add a cron job (node-cron) `0 3 * * *` to call `redis.scan` and delete keys older than TTL if code changes TTL dynamically.\n\n5. Observability & Fallbacks\n   • Log cache hits/misses into winston logger (Task 14 integration).\n   • Emit Prometheus metrics or Sentry breadcrumbs as needed: `airport_cache_hits`, `airport_cache_misses`, `airport_cache_errors`.\n   • On Redis failure, bypass cache and call API to keep feature functional.\n\n6. Configuration & Docs\n   • Update `README.md` and `docker-compose.yml` with Redis service.\n   • Add migration note for staging/production environments.\n\n7. Security & Compliance\n   • No PII stored; still encrypt Redis at-rest in production if policy requires.\n   • Restrict Redis network access to backend container/subnet.\n",
        "testStrategy": "1. Unit Tests (Jest)\n   • `resolveAirport()` returns cached data on second call.\n   • Data expires after TTL by mocking timers.\n   • Concurrent “double-miss” leads to one external API call (use jest mocks & spy count).\n\n2. Integration Tests\n   • Spin up ephemeral Redis with `@testcontainers/redis`.\n   • Stub external API; verify it is hit on first request and skipped subsequently.\n   • Simulate Redis outage; verify API still responds and logs warning.\n\n3. Performance Benchmarks\n   • Measure avg. latency reduction with caching enabled vs. disabled for 1k requests.\n   • Use autocannon to ensure no throughput regression.\n\n4. Security & Config Validation\n   • Attempt to read keys from unauthorized client; ensure firewall/network rules block.\n   • Verify environment variable override of TTL.\n\n5. Observability Tests\n   • Trigger hits/misses and confirm winston logs & metrics counters increment.\n",

        "description": "Introduce Cypress to run browser-level end-to-end tests covering critical user journeys and regression scenarios.",
        "details": "1. Tooling & Installation\n   • Add Cypress v13 (latest stable) as a dev-dependency: `npm install -D cypress`\n   • Add commands to package.json: \"cypress:open\" and \"cypress:run\".\n   • Generate default folder structure with `npx cypress open`, then move it to `tests/e2e` to keep tests outside source tree.\n\n2. Configuration\n   • Create `cypress.config.ts` (TypeScript) with:\n       - `baseUrl` pointing to `http://localhost:5173` (Vite) or env-based URL.\n       - `viewportWidth/Height` (e.g. 1280×800)\n       - `video` recording enabled in CI, disabled locally.\n       - `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` true to speed up auth-related tests (if API keys are in use).\n   • Load `.env` variables (API keys, test users) through `dotenv`.\n   • Force HTTPS in CI pipeline to stay aligned with Security task (Helmet redirect) using `cypress-https` plugin or Nginx reverse proxy.\n\n3. Custom Commands\n   • Add `cypress/support/commands.ts` with helpers such as `cy.loginApiKey()`, `cy.visitAirport(id)`, `cy.switchLang('de')`.\n   • Abstract repetitive selectors via data-attributes: add `data-cy` to UI components from Task 2; update Core UI if missing.\n\n4. Test Coverage\n   a. Smoke Suite (runs on every PR)\n       - Loads home page, asserts header/footer render.\n       - Navigates via TanStack Router to /airports and /settings, asserts 200 responses.\n   b. Airport Explorer Flow\n       - Searches for “Berlin”, selects suggestion, verifies AirportDetails opens and Leaflet map displays marker.\n   c. Security Regression\n       - Ensures all requests are served over HTTPS (window.location.protocol === 'https:').\n       - Confirms CSP headers present via `cy.request('/')`.\n   d. Language Toggle\n       - Switches UI language to German and checks a translated string.\n   e. Error Boundary\n       - Intentionally trigger 404 route, expect custom 404 page (will pass once Task 14 is done but can be marked `@pending`).\n\n5. CI Integration\n   • Add GitHub Actions workflow `e2e.yml` that spins up app, runs headless Cypress in chrome and electron.\n   • Cache Cypress binary for faster builds.\n   • Upload video artifacts only on failure.\n\n6. Reporting & Maintenance\n   • Output JUnit XML for test reporters (Allure or GitHub Summary).\n   • Add `npm run cypress:update-selectors` script to lint for missing `data-cy` attributes.\n   • Document guidelines in `TESTING.md`.\n\nConsiderations\n   • Keep tests deterministic—stub network requests for 3rd-party APIs using `cy.intercept()` when not testing integration.\n   • Use `@focus` tag convention to run a single spec locally.\n   • Use Cypress Component Testing if individual UI components need browser rendering in future.",
        "testStrategy": "1. Local Verification\n   a. Run `npm run cypress:open`, execute all specs, ensure they pass on Chrome & Firefox.\n   b.

Push a branch; verify the `e2e.yml` workflow starts the app, waits on port, and all smoke tests pass under 3 minutes.\n   b. Break an assertion intentionally to confirm pipeline fails and video artifact uploads.\n\n3. Security Assertions\n   a. Disable HTTPS redirect in Helmet config and re-run tests – they must fail, proving assertion effectiveness.\n   b. Tamper with CSP header locally; test should detect missing header and fail.\n\n4. Cross-Environment Check\n   a. Run tests against staging environment via `CYPRESS_BASE_URL=https://staging.example.com npm run cypress:run`.\n   b. Confirm language toggling works with real backend data.\n\n5. Regression Guard\n   • Add the suite to release checklist; every new feature must provide/select appropriate `data-cy` selectors and at least one new E2E scenario.",
