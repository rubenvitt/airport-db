			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Live Flight Tracker",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 18,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Live Flight Tracker into subtasks for real-time data ingestion, map rendering layers, performance optimizations, resilience (reconnect/back-pressure), UX polish, and exhaustive testing (load, stress, e2e).",
			"reasoning": "Combines WebSockets, large real-time datasets, spatial indexing, high-frequency UI updates, and performance tuning, making it one of the most complex features."

			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Offline Capability",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail subtasks for service worker setup, IndexedDB schema, sync conflict resolution, background sync, offline UI states, and offline QA scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "Offline support touches many layers (storage, sync, UI) but uses well-known PWA patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Multi-language Support",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline tasks for i18n setup, translation file management, dynamic loading, component refactors, RTL audits, and automated locale testing.",
			"reasoning": "Mostly configuration and string replacement with limited architectural impact; comparatively lower complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Performance",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 14,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for baseline metrics, code splitting, asset optimization, memory profiling, algorithmic refactors, worker offloading, and performance regression gates.",
			"reasoning": "Requires systemic profiling and optimizations across front-end, API, and build pipeline; high but bounded complexity."
